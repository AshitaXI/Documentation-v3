Enables users to easily override DAT files without actually replacing them. Loads overrides from a set directory so you do not have to overwrite the original game files.

Dats will attempt to load override files from the following path:
```
<Ashita Path>\plugins\dats\
```

Files should be placed in the same folder structure as the real game files, as if the `dats` folder was the `Final Fantasy XI` folder.

## Features

  * Adds the ability to override dat files without modifying the actual game files.

## Commands

This plugin has no commands, simply load it to use it.
